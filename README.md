# JDBC-University-DB-Management

Project Description: University Database Management System

This project showcases my skills in developing a comprehensive University Database Management System. The system is built using Java Swing and AWT concepts, providing a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) window for seamless interaction. It incorporates JDBC code to establish a secure connection with the MySQL database.

The core functionality of the system revolves around managing student data. Upon execution, the Java code establishes a connection with the designated database named "jdbc_db" using the JDBC driver. It then prepares a dynamic query that accommodates user input data from the GUI window.

The GUI window presents a form where users can input essential details such as registration number, name, phone number, and city. Once the user submits the data, the Java code efficiently stores it in the "students" table within the MySQL database. This ensures the seamless integration and persistence of student records.

The project demonstrates my proficiency in Java programming, particularly in utilizing Swing and AWT for GUI development, as well as implementing JDBC for database connectivity. It serves as a robust solution for universities or educational institutions seeking a user-friendly and efficient system to manage student data. By combining intuitive design and reliable database operations, this University Database Management System enhances data management processes and simplifies administrative tasks.
